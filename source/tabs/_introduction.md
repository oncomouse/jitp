# Introduction

Sitting at [#s508](http://jentery.github.io/careRepair/) of the Modern Language Association annual conference in Austin in early January of 2016, I realized that the “care and repair” in the title of the panel wasn’t emanating solely from the panelists. Equally watching the room and [its Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla16 %23s508&src=typd), I could easily connect the sounds of typing in the audience to the transcript unspooling on my screen. Conference tweeting is an act of [what Lauren Klein has called carework](http://lklein.com/2015/06/the-carework-and-codework-of-the-digital-humanities/); it cares by recording and annotating the work of our peers up on the dais, and it repairs by weaving in new conversations and supplying citations, thereby ushering into the room our absent colleagues while constructing a spontaneous bibliography.

But who, exactly, is doing this carework? Sitting in panel after panel, following Twitter carefully, I couldn’t shake an impression that [#MLA16](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla16&src=typd) was largely a community of women who, donating their attention to this task, may be performing this labor at a certain personal cost. For me, the thrill of keeping up and the desire to transcribe effectively sometimes shaded into a far less fun sense of obligation to type quickly and capture everything. Sometimes, I felt that my labors took away from the mental leisure needed to appreciate and reflect on the fantastic presentations I was transcribing.

Yet, at the same time, women actively shaping the academic record (at least, _an_ academic record) had to be a good thing. Right? 

What follows is a snapshot of a moment, rendered in charts---an effort to trace, empirically, the origin of my doubt.

Many thanks to [Andrew Pilsch](http://andrew.pilsch.com) for the many hours he spent developing the interactive aspects of this interface and creating [the d3 figures](http://nvd3.org) from my data. Readers would be stuck with some fairly ugly tables, and would have to scroll quite a bit more, without his labor. 

Thank you as well to [Eileen Clancy](https://twitter.com/clancynewyork), who generously and helpfully reviewed an early draft of this project.
