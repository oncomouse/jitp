# Introduction

Sitting at [#s508](http://jentery.github.io/careRepair/) of the [Modern Language Association annual conference in Austin](https://www.mla.org/Convention/MLA-2016), I realized that the “care and repair” in the title of the panel wasn’t emanating solely from the panelists. Equally watching the room and [its Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla16 %23s508&src=typd), I could easily connect the sounds of typing in the audience to the transcript unspooling on my screen. Conference tweeting is an act of [what Lauren Klein has called carework](http://lklein.com/2015/06/the-carework-and-codework-of-the-digital-humanities/); it cares by recording and annotating the work of our peers up on the dais, and it repairs by weaving in new conversations and ignored citations, thereby ushering into the room our absent colleagues.

But who, exactly, is doing this carework? Sitting in panel after panel, following Twitter carefully, I couldn’t shake an impression that [#MLA16](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mla16&src=typd) was largely a community of women who, donating their attention to this task, risked becoming a digital secretarial pool. For me, the thrill of keeping up, the desire to develop mastery over the medium, quickly shaded into being mastered by the task. Yet, at the same time, women actively shaping the academic record, actively determining how the conference was represented, had to be a good thing. Right?

What follows is a snapshot of a moment, rendered in charts---an effort to trace, empirically, the origin of my doubt.
