# Conclusion

Did #MLA16 pass [the Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test)? In a word, yes. Women mentioning or citing other women constituted 27.78% of all tweets. Of the 792 total tweets, 220 of them---almost precisely the total number of all men’s tweets (222)---were women writing about women. (By contrast, men tweeting about other men constituted only 6.94% of all tweets, whereas women tweeting about men constituted 18.18% of all tweets.) During these panels, women performed the bulk of the carework, ensuring that panels were summarized, works were cited, links were shared, and audience members and those not present in the conference were brought into the experience remotely. Women made sure that other women’s voices were heard. 

My advice for the future is not to let taking care of the panelists, of the audience, and of other academics does not devolve into secretarial drudgery. (Unless, of course, you genuinely enjoy reportage, in which case, we should thank you for your work.) Make sure you take care of yourself as well: [cite yourself more](http://www.eigenfactor.org/gender/self-citation/SelfCitation.pdf) and share more of your own ideas, reactions, and questions. If a super-tweeter is busy working (and happy about doing so), let them do that labor, and show your appreciation by forming other kinds of tweets and participating in backchannel exchanges. Men, too, may want to take more care of other men and take on more of the labor of sharing citations and bringing in more people to the Twitter feed. Above all, both male and female tweeters, do not let a perceived duty to document squeeze out your chance to comment, argue, connect, link, and intervene in the conversation.

Were I to run such a test again, there are some changes I would make. First, I would attend more panels so that I could extend the dataset (although if tweeters knew in advance their tweets would be recorded as gendered behavior, it might alter those behaviors). Second, I would record the data _across time_ to reveal chronological trends, such as when different types of tweets wax or wane and how influential tweets or tweeters change patterns in a given panel. This chronological dimension was, after all, partly responsible for the hunch that led me to do this in the first place. Third, I would examine the limits of the simple gender binary I have used (e.g., do tweeters really self-identify their genders, and are two genders really enough here?) Finally, what about women of color? Are they performing more of this carework than white women? In general, would race be a useful distinction to make? Considering that one of the panels was the [Disrupting DH](http://www.disruptingdh.com/) panel--during which the diversity of the audience was explcitly noted--it may be true that this panel disrupted not just DH, but #DH as well.
