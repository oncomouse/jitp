# Methods

I quantified what happened in the DH panels I attended for which there are Storifies (courtesy of [Eileen Clancy](https://twitter.com/clancynewyork)): #280, #s411, and #s508. No other panels’ feeds were incorporated because it was necessary to have been there to sort tweets into categories accurately. As Clancy pointed out when I reached out for permission to use her work---for [her Storifies](https://storify.com/clancynewyork) are also a work of care---some super-tweeters might skew the results; this certainly means I cannot draw firm conclusions about “all” male and female academics on Twitter. But I am not concerned here with essentializing gendered tweeting habits---for, as I show, they are highly contextualized---beyond the scope of my data. And I am less concerned with individuals than with the _record as it stands_, which includes those super-tweeters. (For the record, #s280 and #s508 each had one super-tweeter, while #s411 had no super-tweeter.) As other feminists in DH might put it, I am concerned here with the "optics" of what happened there and then, rather than with guessing individual tweeters' intentions or theorizing timeless categories.

Two sets of data were tracked, the first being the gender of people mentioned in the tweet. Categories included tweeters, presenters, non-presenters (typically, audience members and those not present in the room), and “no male/female identified.” Tweets from organizations were not counted because their accounts did not emphasize gendered markers in their avatars or profiles. When more than one person is mentioned in a tweet, I defaulted to the first person mentioned not only to avoid tweets double-counting, but also because this case study is recording the rhetoric embedded in each tweet through structure and emphasis. 

However, when a presenter and a non-presenter are mentioned, I counted the non-presenter because such tweets emphasize this new person while making sure the presenter would still be tagged. Moderators and conference organizers counted as presenters if they made extended remarks to theorize the panel (something far more substantive than author biographies) and were _visually present_ (at the table beside presenters), but as non-presenters if they did not make remarks beyond presenter biographies and sat with the audience. To avoid mislabeling a participant, if a person was invoked but not actually named, the tweet counted as “no male/female identified” unless the gender of the person invoked was explicitly indicated in that particular tweet (e.g., through pronouns). 

The second data set collected was the topic---more accurately, the rhetorical function---of each tweet: meta-comment, summary/quotation, citation, response/question, and room climate. **Meta-comment tweets** refer to the objective state of the panel (has it begun, who is speaking, what are the paper titles, who can or cannot attend), whereas **room climate tweets** comment on the atmosphere of the room (big, small, crowded, loud, empty, cold, hot). Both categories point to the event-ness of the panel, rather than its intellectual content.

**Summary or quotation tweets** record what was said by panelists, or by audience members during Q&A, with an aim to reproducing accurately what is going on. Such tweets are reportage and make up the majority of "carework" tweets. By contrast, **response or question tweets** are evaluative in nature; they judge, reflect, and editorialize so that the tweeter participates actively in the conversation. These tweets often ask panelists questions about their ideas, engage in conversation with other audience members, or bringing in an absent colleague into the Twitter stream. Such tweets are transformative rather than secretarial.

**Citation tweets** provide citations, giving URLs leading to work by the panelists; to books and articles mentioned by the panelists; or to work that the tweeter considers relevant but had not been invoked by the panelists.  These tweets are outward-facing, unlike meta-comment or room climate tweets; they direct the reader to sources, scholars, or moments outside the room. Like Summary/quotation tweets, Citation tweets perform important labor for the panel by spontaneously constructing a bibliography.

A few tweets might technically have counted in more than one category. I judged which category by counting the number of words that reflected the two categories and classifying it in the one with the greatest number. If the balance between the number of words fitting two categories was equal, I classified the tweet according to the position of each category; for example, a tweet that begin with strong evaluative language and expressive punctuation (such as multiple exclamation marks), but then summarized the presenter’s words, was counted as Response/question, not Summary/quotation.
